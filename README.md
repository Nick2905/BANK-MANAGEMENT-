⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-management-system.git
cd bank-management-system

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

pip install streamlit

3️⃣ Run the Application
streamlit run app.py

🧩 How It Works

When a new account is created, a unique account number is generated using random letters, digits, and symbols.

Account details are saved inside data.json.

Each transaction (deposit/withdraw) updates the file automatically.

PIN-based authentication ensures account security.



🧠 Future Enhancements

Add user authentication (login/signup)

Integrate with SQLite or MySQL database

Add transaction history and PDF statement download

Enable OTP/email verification for extra security
